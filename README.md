# Dylan's dotfiles

This repo contains all my various dotfiles for configuration on a unix based system.

## Ubuntu

Running the ubuntu_install.sh will set up the required dotfile dependencies.

## VsCode

To install the dependencies need for vscode you will need to install neovim and insure it is on the path. Then you can take the init.vim located at the root of this repo and place it wherever the init.vim is typicall stored. This will allow you to use neovim from with VsCode.
